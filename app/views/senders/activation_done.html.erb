<h2>Thank You!</h2>
<p>Thank you for choosing to activate the LoveCards service!</p>
<p>From now on, until you decide not to, we'll send you from time to time 
  reminders with love words to be sent to <%=@letter.recipient.name%>.</p>
<p>Everytime you choose to send a new love letter to <%=@letter.recipient.name%>,
   we will schedule a new reminder for you 17-20 days later.</p>
<p>Giving up is as easy as ignoring the last reminder altogether, but you do this
   at your own full risk! You may don't want to mess with <%=@letter.recipient.first_name%>!</p>
<p>Resuming the service is as easy as to just pick one of the love words from
   the last reminder or login into LoveCards site with your user and password sent
   at the activation time.</p>
<p>Don't worry, if you don't recall the login credentials! Your username is your e-mail 
  address, <code><%=@letter.sender.email%></code> and your password is 
  <code><%=@letter.sender.password%></code>, but you can always ask for it if forgotten.</p>
<p>Enjoy the LoveCard service, but most important, the happy life with 
   <%=@letter.recipient.first_name%>!</p>
<%end%>
