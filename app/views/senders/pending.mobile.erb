      <p>An e-mail was sent to your e-mail address <%=@letter.sender.email%> which
         contains an activation link for this service. We need this to confirm your
         e-mail address.</p>
      <p>Once the activation is completed, the selected love message will be sent to
         <%=@letter.recipient.name%> as comming from you, and signed by you.</p>
      <p>This will generate a remarcable reaction which will last for at least 2-3 weeks.
         Then, we'll send you an email with other love messages you can choose from, and 
         so on, forever!</p>
      <p>The life can't be better than this, that's promissed!</p>
      <p>Enjoy the yourLove.ly service, but most important, the happy life with 
         <%=@letter.recipient.first_name%>!</p>
